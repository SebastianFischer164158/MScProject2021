This directory is exclusively used for testing.

See example:
https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/tutorials/core/unit_testing_blink.html


To run tests:
pio test -e BOARDNAME(S) --verbose
e.g.
pio test -e nodemcuv2 -e esp32-dev --verbose
or:
pio test -e nodemcuv2
pio test -e esp32-dev

Or simply select the platofrmio test | board and execute


If you require code styles and suggestion, then check if the following error in CLion occurs:
"This file does not belong to any project target; code insight feautres might nto work properly."

Then you must go to CMakeLists.txt and manualy add the following:
add_executable(Z_DUMMY_TARGET ${SRC_LIST} test/test_XYZ.cpp)

and then execute the relevant tests by the commands specified above.
Remember to remove the add_executable once testing is done.

If multiple boards are needed for testing (i.e. concurrent testing)
the explicit ports most be ensured are correct for each device within the platformio.ini environment file.
